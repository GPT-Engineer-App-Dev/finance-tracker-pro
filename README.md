Create the following pages and components:

1. A Home page at route / with: 
- A heading "My Budget App"
- A navbar with links to "Transactions" and "Export"
- Show a "Total Balance" by summing all income transactions and subtracting all expenses. Format it as currency.
- A footer with a copyright notice

2. A Transactions page at route /transactions with:
- A table listing all transactions with columns for date, amount, type (income/expense), and category
- Buttons to add, edit, and delete each transaction
- Filters for type (income/expense), category, and date range
- Date range filter should have fields for start and end date

3. An Add Transaction page at route /transactions/add with:
- A form with fields for date (date picker), amount (number input), type (radio buttons for income/expense), category (dropdown with options like Groceries, Bills, Salary, etc)
- A submit button labeled "Add Transaction" that saves the new transaction and navigates back to the Transactions page

4. Shared layout with navbar and footer used on all pages

For now, use mock data for the transactions. Example:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "date": "2023-04-15",
    "amount": 100,
    "type": "income", 
    "category": "Salary"
  },
  {
    "id": 2, 
    "date": "2023-04-20",
    "amount": -50,
    "type": "expense",
    "category": "Groceries"  
  }
]
